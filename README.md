 If you need more calls per minute, increased up time, more frequent weather updates, or secured access, you’ll need to pay subscription.

To do this, register your application  by <a href="http://openweathermap.org/appid">signing up</a> for an account. Once logged in, you can find the key under the setup tab. Since the API is public access, the key needs to be added as a parameter to whatever API endpoint you send a request to.
